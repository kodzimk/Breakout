# Breakout 

 we rather keep things simple, we're going to base our 2D game on an already existing 2D arcade game. Introducing Breakout, a classic 2D game released in 1976 on the Atari 2600 console. Breakout requires the player, who controls a small horizontal paddle, to destroy all the bricks by bouncing a small ball against each brick without allowing the ball to reach the bottom edge. Once the player destroys all bricks, he completes the game.
